# DO NOT IGNORE! THIS IS IMPORTANT!
Do NOT move the "assets" folder, nor delete it. As without it the game will NOT run, It contains all important files apart from the ones WITH the executable; (only for people who use the precompiled one.)

# For Modders/Other Developers
You can mod my game if you'd like, I actually think it'd be cool to see some mods, maybe in a later version I'll make modding more accessable by adding a "mods" folder or smth. For now you can recompile the game with any new or less code you'd like. Have fun!
